# Bash_Command_Tool
This is Qiheng's repo for IDS 706 project 2 Bash Command-Line Tool.

The command line tool we realized is called datafactory, which generates number of noise data that could be set in a specific scale and stores the result to a `.txt` file. We believe the noise data could be useful in the data preparation stage, as the noise data could later be utilized to test program robustness and abnormaly detection.
